### [Project -3 : Colour Image to pencil sketch](https://github.com/ABHIROMAN/Photo-sketching)
- Here we need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image
- This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo
- Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this programmatically 
- Using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.
